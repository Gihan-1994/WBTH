1. Read the Notion page at https://www.notion.so/2ad2958950ce80de9f06e693b9de9677?source=copy_link
2. Parse the "Delivery Plan" table to identify tasks and their statuses.
3. Update `task.md` to reflect the current state of tasks:
    - Add new tasks found in Notion.
    - Update the status of existing tasks (e.g., mark as done if checked in Notion).
4. Report any discrepancies or new items found.
